    "content": "<p>As we age, our digestive system doesn’t always keep up the way it used to. You might feel more bloated, backed up, or just… slow. But it’s not something you have to just accept. Here’s what’s happening — and how to support your gut naturally.</p><h2 style=\"font-size:1.5rem; font-weight:bold; margin-top:1.5rem;\">1. Enzyme Production Decreases</h2><p>Your body makes fewer digestive enzymes with age. These enzymes help break down protein, fat, and carbs. Without enough of them, food sits longer in your stomach and gut — leading to gas, bloating, and discomfort.</p><h2 style=\"font-size:1.5rem; font-weight:bold; margin-top:1.5rem;\">2. Your Gut Motility Slows Down</h2><p>The muscle contractions that move food through your digestive tract (called peristalsis) tend to weaken over time. This means slower transit, more constipation, and a heavier feeling after meals.</p><h2 style=\"font-size:1.5rem; font-weight:bold; margin-top:1.5rem;\">3. You May Have Less Stomach Acid</h2><p>Contrary to what you might think, low stomach acid is common as you get older — and it can lead to indigestion and poor nutrient absorption. Many people mistake this for having too much acid, but it’s often the opposite.</p><h2 style=\"font-size:1.5rem; font-weight:bold; margin-top:1.5rem;\">4. Your Microbiome Changes</h2><p>Gut bacteria play a huge role in digestion and immune function. As we age, the diversity of these bacteria often declines — which can disrupt digestion, trigger inflammation, and affect mood and energy.</p><h2 style=\"font-size:1.5rem; font-weight:bold; margin-top:1.5rem;\">How to Keep Things Moving</h2><p>Good news: there’s a lot you can do to support digestion, even as your body changes. Here are some simple strategies:</p><ul><li><strong>Take Digestive Enzymes</strong> with meals to help break food down more efficiently.</li><li><strong>Add Magnesium</strong> to support muscle function and promote regularity.</li><li><strong>Move Daily</strong> — walking after meals works wonders for digestion.</li><li><strong>Hydrate</strong> — water is key for motility and nutrient transport.</li><li><strong>Eat Fiber</strong> (especially from vegetables and chia or flaxseeds) to help food pass smoothly.</li><li><strong>Try Probiotics</strong> to support healthy gut bacteria and reduce bloating.</li></ul><p>Just like strength training for your muscles, your gut needs support as you age. Don’t ignore the signs — give your digestion the attention it deserves, and your energy and mood will follow.</p>"
