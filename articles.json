      "content": "Fasting isn\u2019t just about skipping meals \u2014 your body goes through real, powerful changes as the hours pass. Here\u2019s a simple breakdown of what happens:\n\n**Hour 0\u20134: The Fed State**\nYou're still digesting your last meal. Blood sugar and insulin are elevated. Not much \u201cfasting\u201d happening yet.\n\n**Hour 4\u20138: Blood Sugar Drops**\nInsulin starts to fall. Your body begins looking for stored energy. Mild hunger might kick in.\n*Tip:* Stay hydrated \u2014 electrolyte powder helps keep your energy stable here.\n\n**Hour 8\u201312: Fat-Burn Mode Begins**\nWith insulin low, your body taps into fat stores. This is where the real benefits begin.\n*Optional Support:* Exogenous ketones like Liquid BHB can help fuel you during this phase.\n\n**Hour 12\u201316: Ketosis + Mental Clarity**\nYou\u2019re in light ketosis now. Your brain may feel clearer, and inflammation may be decreasing.\n*Stack idea:* Lion\u2019s Mane for mental sharpness while fasted.\n\n**Hour 16\u201320: Deep Fasting Zone**\nHuman Growth Hormone (HGH) spikes, helping repair cells and preserve muscle. Fat-burning intensifies.\n\n**Hour 20\u201324: Autophagy Activation**\nYour body starts deep cleaning \u2014 breaking down old or damaged cells.\n\n**Need to break the fast?**\nDo it gently \u2014 with protein, healthy fats, and ideally magnesium glycinate to calm your nervous system and digestion.\n\n**Final Thought**\nEven short fasts (12\u201316 hrs) offer real benefits. Listen to your body, stay hydrated, and don\u2019t force it. Fasting is a tool \u2014 not a punishment."
