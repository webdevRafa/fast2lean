Here’s what you really need to know.</p><h2 style=\"font-size:1.5rem; font-weight:bold; margin-top:1.5rem;\">1. What Is a Calorie Deficit?</h2><p>A calorie deficit happens when you burn more calories than you consume. Your body makes up the difference by using stored energy — aka fat.</p><h2 style=\"font-size:1.5rem; font-weight:bold; margin-top:1.5rem;\">2. How to Calculate Yours</h2><p>First, find your <strong>BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)</strong> — the number of calories your body needs at rest. Then factor in your activity level to estimate <strong>TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)</strong>. Eating 300–500 calories below that is a safe, sustainable deficit.</p><h2 style=\"font-size:1.5rem; font-weight:bold; margin-top:1.5rem;\">3. Quality Still Matters</h2><p>Calories aren’t everything. The quality of your food affects hunger, energy, and results. Prioritize protein, fiber, and whole foods to feel full while eating less.</p><h2 style=\"font-size:1.5rem; font-weight:bold; margin-top:1.5rem;\">4. Don’t Cut Too Much</h2><p>Drastically slashing calories can backfire. It slows your metabolism, increases cravings, and makes it harder to maintain muscle. Slow and steady wins this race.</p><h2 style=\"font-size:1.5rem; font-weight:bold; margin-top:1.5rem;\">The Smart Way to Do It</h2><p>Track your intake, stay consistent, and aim for a small deficit. Combine that with strength training and sleep — and you’ve got a recipe for real fat loss that sticks.</p>"
