          The Paleo Diet, short for ‚ÄúPaleolithic,‚Äù is about eating the way
          humans evolved to eat ‚Äî before processed foods, agriculture, and
          industrialized oils.
          <br />
          <br />
          Think meats, fish, fruits, and vegetables. Things you could
          hypothetically hunt, gather, or grow without a factory. The goal?
          Reduce inflammation, support digestion, and fuel your body with
          nutrient-dense real food.

          Does Paleo Work With Intermittent Fasting or Keto?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          Paleo naturally pairs well with intermittent fasting. Because it
          removes processed foods and sugar, blood sugar stays stable longer ‚Äî
          making it easier to go without snacking or eating every few hours.
          <br />
          <br />
          While Paleo isn‚Äôt as low-carb as strict keto, many people do a ‚Äú
          <strong>Paleo-keto hybrid</strong>‚Äù by choosing mostly fat and protein
          from clean, ancestral sources. This combo can help with fat loss,
          inflammation, and mental clarity.
