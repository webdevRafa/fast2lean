            🕐 What Is Intermittent Fasting?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Intermittent Fasting (IF) isn’t about <strong>what</strong> you eat
            — it’s about <strong>when</strong>. Instead of eating all day long,
            you eat within a specific window (like 8 hours on, 16 hours off).
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            It's a small habit that has a big impact. Giving your body regular
            breaks from eating can unlock more energy, better focus, and even a
            more stable mood.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            And here’s something a lot of people don’t realize — you don’t have
            to eat less. Intermittent Fasting isn’t about cutting calories; it’s
            about choosing when to eat those same calories. Whether you’re
            eating 2 meals or 3 within your window, the goal is to give your
            body a break, not deprive it.{" "}
            <strong>It’s structure — not restriction.</strong>
